# Design Principles Java Project

This repository demonstrates key software design principles using Java. Each principle is illustrated with clear, practical code examples, showing both good and bad implementations. The goal is to help learners understand and apply these principles for more efficient, maintainable, and scalable software development.

## Principles Covered

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):**  
  Classes should have only one reason to change. See examples in [`src/SingleResponsibility/Baker/`](src/SingleResponsibility/Baker/).

- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):**  
  Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. See [`src/Open_Closed_Principle/Shape/`](src/Open_Closed_Principle/Shape/).

- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):**  
  Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types. See [`src/Liskov_Subsitution_Principle/`](src/Liskov_Subsitution_Principle/).

- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):**  
  Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. See [`src/InterfaceSegregationPrinciple/`](src/InterfaceSegregationPrinciple/).

- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):**  
  High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but on abstractions. See [`src/DependencyInversionPrinciple/`](src/DependencyInversionPrinciple/).

- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):**  
  Simplicity should be a key goal in design. See [`src/KISS/`](src/KISS/).

- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):**  
  Avoid code duplication. See [`src/DRY/`](src/DRY/).
